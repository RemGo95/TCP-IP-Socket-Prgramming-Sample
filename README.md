<br/>
Hi there<br/>
This is a simple example of using Socket Programming about connecting and sending messages from each side.<br/>
even without locking for waiting connection<br/>
used libraries of Net, Net.Sockets, IO<br/>
in two Applications. one in Client and another is for Server. <br/>
I tried to make a bit user friendly <br/>
